Overview: "Trango self-hosted is a calling and file sharing solution that works over\
  \ LAN (local area networks). It does not need to involve the internet for calling\
  \ or file sharing. Ideal for offices, hotels, houses, restaurants, and any space\
  \ where people use the same Public IP address or the same Wi-Fi network. The package\
  \ comes with a discovery server and a web app that can be deployed on the local\
  \ machine and can be accessed from anywhere in the network.\r\n"
