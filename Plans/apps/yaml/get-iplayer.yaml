Overview: "get_iplayer has PVR-like capabilities (like Sky+ / TiVo / Series-Link);\
  \ You can save lists of programme searches which are automatically recorded when\
  \ they become available so that you can watch them when you choose and on devices\
  \ that cannot run Adobe Flash Player \u2013 even if you don\u2019t have adequate\
  \ broadband speeds or if your broadband streams too slowly at peak hours when you\
  \ want to watch a programme."
