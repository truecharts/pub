  \ you and certain death![br]SkyFactory\xAE One is a modernization of the original\
  \ SkyFactory for Minecraft 1.6.4. The goal of this project is to remain true to\
  \ the original modpack while updating features and mods to 1.16.5. Find yourself\
  \ sieving for resources, twerk for trees, decorate your trophy room, exploring a\
  \ deep, dark dimension, and much more! Many original mods have returned joined by\
  \ several new and updated mods! And what would SkyFactory be without ForceCraft,\
  \ a reconstruction of the original DartCraft mod.[br]SkyFactory One delivers a nostalgic\
  \ experience with the quality of life upgrades to make it even more exciting! If\
  \ you've never played SkyFactory before, prepare for a fresh experience in a modded\
  \ skyblock. The original can never be replaced, but we can sure try!"
