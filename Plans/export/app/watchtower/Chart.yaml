description: "With watchtower you can update the running version of your containerized\
  \ app simply by pushing a new image to the Docker Hub or your own image registry.\
  \ Watchtower will pull down your new image, gracefully shut down your existing container\
  \ and restart it with the same options that were used when it was deployed initially.\
  \ \r\n"
