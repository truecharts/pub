description: 'Simple soundboard for discord. You can trigger sounds by commands typed
  in the Discord chat, or you can choose the sound from the web UI. You will need
  to create a bot account that the bot will use to join and play sounds. The bot can
  only play sounds/respond to commands for servers it has been given access. Get your
  bot token from here - https://discord.com/developers/applications. This will not
  work correctly without a proper Bot Token and the bot application being added to
  your discord server. Join the official discord: https://discord.gg/kZTNtfW for support'
