description: "HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it\u2019s\
  \ completely free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source,\
  \ it\u2019s perfectly legal. For more info. HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK\
  \ which in turn was a successor of freakschat."
