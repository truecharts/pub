description: 'SkyFactory One Modded Minecraft Server[br][br]The new ultimate skyblock
  modpack! Watch development at: darkosto.tv/SkyFactoryOneLive[br]It''s skyblock like
  you''ve never seen it before... Or have you?! High tech mods, automation, and spawning
  in the void with nothing but a tree and a single piece of dirt between you and certain
  death![br]SkyFactory One is a modernization of the original SkyFactory for Minecraft
  1.6.4. The goal of this project is to remain true to the original modpack while
  updating features and mods to 1.16.5. Find yourself sieving for resources, twerk
  for trees, decorate your trophy room, exploring a deep, dark dimension, and much
  more! Many original mods have returned joined by several new and updated mods! And
  what would SkyFactory be without ForceCraft, a reconstruction of the original DartCraft
  mod.[br]SkyFactory One delivers a nostalgic experience with the quality of life
  upgrades to make it even more exciting! If you''ve never played SkyFactory before,
  prepare for a fresh experience in a modded skyblock. The original can never be replaced,
  but we can sure try!'
