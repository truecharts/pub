description: 'Pomerium is an identity-aware proxy that enables secure access to internal
  applications. Pomerium provides a standardized interface to add access control to
  applications regardless of whether the application itself has authorization or authentication
  baked-in. Pomerium gateways both internal and external requests, and can be used
  in situations where you''d typically reach for a VPN. Check ports to ensure you
  do not have conflicts. **NOTE** You MUST: 1.Create a config.yaml file in appdata/pomerium/pomerium.
  The parameters for the file can be found here: https://www.pomerium.io/reference/
  2. Match your cookie secret in both the file and the variable below.'
