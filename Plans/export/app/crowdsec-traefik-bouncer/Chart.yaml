description: "CrowdSec bouncer for Traefik to block malicious IPs from accessing your\
  \ services. This utilizes Traefik v2 ForwardAuth Middleware and queries CrowdSec\
  \ with the client IP. If the client IP is on the ban list, Traefik will issue a\
  \ HTTP code 403 response. Otherwise, the request will continue as usual.\r\n"
