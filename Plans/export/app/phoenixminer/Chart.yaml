description: Containerised version of PhoenixMiner. Helps turn your Unraid server
  into an Ethereum / cryptocurrency mining rig. Contains AMD drivers. Not affected
  by the AMD reset bug as it doesn't rely on vfio. Works with most Nvidia GPUs as
  well via Open Source drivers. Check the support link for detailed installation instructions.
